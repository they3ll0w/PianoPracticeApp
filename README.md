    Randomly selects between major and minor keys.
    Randomly selects a musical key (e.g., C major, G minor).
    Randomly selects a type of music skill practice exercise (e.g., arpeggios, scales, chords).
    Generates a random exercise based on the selected key and exercise type.
    Displays the generated exercise in a graphical user interface (GUI).
